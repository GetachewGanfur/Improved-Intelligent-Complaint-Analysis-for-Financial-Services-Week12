## Week 6 Progress Report
**Due Date:** Sunday 17.08 8 pm UTC  
**Project:** Intelligent Complaint Analysis for Financial Services using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

---

## 1. Project Overview and Business Understanding

### Project Chosen
**Intelligent Complaint Analysis for Financial Services using RAG Technology**

This project addresses a critical business need in the financial services industry by implementing an intelligent system that can analyze and respond to customer complaints using advanced AI techniques. The system leverages the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) complaint database to provide intelligent, context-aware responses to queries about financial service issues.

### Business Understanding
- **Problem**: Financial institutions receive thousands of complaints daily, making it difficult to analyze patterns, identify common issues, and provide timely responses
- **Impact**: Poor complaint handling leads to customer dissatisfaction, regulatory issues, and increased operational costs
- **Solution**: An AI-powered RAG system that can intelligently analyze complaints, identify patterns, and provide actionable insights

### Tasks to be Done
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing** - Analyze CFPB complaint dataset and prepare for processing
2. **Text Chunking and Embedding** - Implement intelligent text segmentation and vector embeddings
3. **Vector Store Creation** - Build FAISS-based search index for efficient retrieval
4. **RAG Pipeline Implementation** - Develop the core retrieval-augmented generation system
5. **Evaluation Framework** - Create comprehensive testing and assessment tools
6. **Interactive User Interface** - Build user-friendly chat interface for querying the system
